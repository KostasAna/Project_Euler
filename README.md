In this repository I am uploading the methods I used to solve the problems posted on https://projecteuler.net/archives

In the [Project_Euler.py](https://github.com/KostasAna/Project_Euler/blob/main/Project_Euler.py) file I create the functions needed for every problem and in [main_test.py](https://github.com/KostasAna/Project_Euler/blob/main/main_test.py) file I compute the answers

First 15 completed.
